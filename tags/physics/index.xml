It&amp;rsquo;s a demo of the double-slits experiment. I already had some Java code which I wrote ages ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never got round to converting it to Javascript 1. Elm seems like a nice alternative so I decided to give it a try.
Number of slits 1 2 3 4 5 6 The app shows the light source, slits and the screen with an intensity graph of the diffraction pattern.</description></item></channel></rss>
