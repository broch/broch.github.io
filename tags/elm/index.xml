Now we&amp;rsquo;ll extend the code to check the chosen password against the huge database maintained by Have I been pwned?. The code for this part is similar, but instead of decoding the result of a call to Javascript to obtain our data, we make an HTTP request and decode the response.
The full code for both parts can be found on github.</description></item><item><title>Checking Password Strength in Elm, Part 1: Zxcvbn</title><link>https://broch.tech/posts/elm-zxcvbn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://broch.tech/posts/elm-zxcvbn/</guid><description>As part of a recent Elm project, I wrote some front-end user registration code which required that new users choose a password. I used the zxcvbn library to measure password strength and this seems like a good, non-trivial example to show how to call Javascript from Elm. In Part 2, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to add extra checks by calling the Have I Been Pwned passwords API which maintains a database of half a billion compromised password hashes.</description></item><item><title>Double-Slit Diffraction in Elm</title><link>https://broch.tech/posts/double-slits-elm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://broch.tech/posts/double-slits-elm/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to try Elm for some time and finally made the effort to write some code. It&amp;rsquo;s a demo of the double-slits experiment. I already had some Java code which I wrote ages ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never got round to converting it to Javascript 1. Elm seems like a nice alternative so I decided to give it a try.
Number of slits 1 2 3 4 5 6 The app shows the light source, slits and the screen with an intensity graph of the diffraction pattern.</description></item></channel></rss>
