The content is mostly gleaned from my research into the code of several WAI-based web frameworks to try to understand how they work. Building a web application was one of the things I tackled when I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know Haskell well enough, so hopefully this will be useful if you&amp;rsquo;re at a similar stage and would like to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a bit more depth.</description></item></channel></rss>
